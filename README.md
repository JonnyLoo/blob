## to-dos
- [x] update logic so that player eats smaller blob but is eaten by bigger blob
- [x] make blobs appear endlessly
- [x] make is obvious which blobs are smaller / which is larger (color)
- [x] score keeping / display
- [x] have a win screen
- [x] main menu / pause button
- [x] make a bit more diffcult? (feels kinda easy)
- [x] lose condition / screen + shrinking player + losing points display
- [x] cheat menu (w to win, l to lose, r to restart)
- [ ] sometimes progress bar doesn't update (but you still gain or lose points)
- [ ] add music
