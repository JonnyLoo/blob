# blob

## to-dos
- [x] update logic so that player eats smaller blob but is eaten by bigger blob
- [x] make blobs appear endlessly
- [x] make is obvious which blobs are smaller / which is larger (color)
- [x] score keeping / display
- [ ] have a win screen
- [ ] main menu / pause button
- [ ] make a bit more diffcult? (feels kinda easy)
- [ ] cheat menu for easier testing?
