        <h2>Goal</h2>
        <p>Player moves around in the canvas to eat blobs smaller than itself and avoid bigger blobs. The blobs will be coming from all 4 directions and move either horizontally or diagonally. The level of difficulty will determine the maximum speed of the blobs. The player increases in energy level when it eats a blob and increases in size so that it can eat bigger blobs.
        </p>
        <h2>Inspiration</h2>
        <p>We were inspired by agar.io where you collect blobs and grow larger while simultaneously avoiding other larger players who will try to eat you. Also games are fun to make :)
