    <h2>Goal</h2>
    <p>Player moves around in the canvas to eat blobs smaller
       than itself and avoid bigger blobs.
       The blobs will be coming from all 4 directions and move
       either horizontally or diagonally. The level of difficulty
       will determine the maximum speed of the blobs. The player
       increases in energy level when it eats a blob and increases
       in size so that it can eat bigger blobs.
     </p>
     <h2>Inspiration</h2>
     <p>We were inspired by agar.io where you collect blobs and grow larger while
       simultaneously avoiding other larger players who will try to eat you.
       Also games are fun to make :)
